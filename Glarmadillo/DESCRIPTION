Description: Provides an efficient implementation of the Graphical Lasso algorithm, 
    which employs an L1 penalty term to estimate sparse inverse covariance matrices 
    from multivariate normal distribution observations. In addition to solving the 
    Graphical Lasso problem, this package includes functionality to generate random sparse 
    covariance matrices which are useful in simulations and teaching of graphical models.
    The package leverages the Armadillo C++ library for fast and accurate computations.
